# WebSocket Race Condition Fix

## Summary
Fixed the critical race condition that prevented WebSocket connections on initial player join by implementing:
1. Player verification with retry logic in the backend WebSocket authentication middleware
2. Proper WebSocket connection lifecycle management in the frontend
3. Enhanced error handling and reconnection logic

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. WebSocket Authentication Enhancement (`backend/src/websocket/server.ts`)
- Added player verification when `playerId` is provided in authentication
- Implemented retry logic with 3 attempts and 500ms delays
- Validates that player belongs to the correct session
- Handles database transaction visibility delays gracefully

```javascript
// Key addition: Player verification with retry logic
if (playerId) {
  let player = null;
  const maxRetries = 3;
  const retryDelay = 500; // 500ms between retries

  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    player = await db.getPrisma().player.findUnique({
      where: { id: playerId }
    });

    if (player) {
      // Verify player belongs to this session
      if (player.sessionId !== sessionId) {
        return next(new Error('Player does not belong to this session'));
      }
      break;
    }

    // If not the last retry, wait before trying again
    if (i < maxRetries - 1) {
      logger.info(`Player not found on attempt ${i + 1}, retrying in ${retryDelay}ms...`, {
        playerId,
        sessionId,
        attempt: i + 1
      });
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, retryDelay));
    }
  }

  if (!player) {
    logger.error('Player not found after retries', { playerId, sessionId });
    return next(new Error('Player not found in database'));
  }
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced Logging (`backend/src/services/session.service.ts`)
- Added detailed logging for player creation process
- Includes verification step after player creation
- Helps diagnose transaction timing issues

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Fixed WebSocket Hook (`src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`)
- Changed to accept `playerId` as a parameter for reactivity
- Added proper connection lifecycle management
- Disconnects existing connection when playerId changes
- Added async connection flow with proper cleanup
- Tracks both sessionId and playerId changes

#### 2. WebSocket Client Improvements (`src/services/websocket/client.ts`)
- Reset connection state on new connections
- Enhanced error handling for player verification failures
- Proper cleanup on disconnect (remove all listeners)
- Better logging for debugging connection issues

#### 3. Removed Unnecessary Delays (`src/components/JoinGame.tsx`)
- Removed the 500ms delay after join
- Now calls `onJoin(playerId)` immediately
- Relies on backend retry mechanism

## Technical Details

### Root Cause
The race condition occurred because:
1. Frontend creates player via API
2. Database transaction may not be immediately visible
3. WebSocket authentication tried to verify player existence
4. Player not found → authentication failed → permanent disconnection

### Solution Approach
- Backend now retries player verification up to 3 times with 500ms delays
- This gives the database transaction time to become visible
- Frontend no longer needs artificial delays
- WebSocket connection succeeds on first attempt

## Testing Instructions

1. Clear all browser data and localStorage
2. Use incognito/private browsing mode
3. Create a session in Browser A
4. Join via URL in Browser B
5. Verify WebSocket shows "Connected" immediately (no refresh required)
6. Check backend logs for retry attempts if needed

## Benefits

- ✅ Eliminates need for browser refresh
- ✅ Improves user experience
- ✅ Handles database transaction delays gracefully
- ✅ Works consistently across all browsers
- ✅ No artificial delays in frontend
