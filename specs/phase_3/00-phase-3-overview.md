# Phase 3: Production Refinement & Bug Fixes

## Overview
Phase 3 focuses on refining the Planning Poker application to production-ready quality by fixing critical bugs, implementing missing Phase 2 features, and ensuring a stable, polished user experience.

## Current State Assessment

### Working Features âœ…
1. Basic session creation and management
2. Player join/leave functionality with avatars
3. UI components and layout structure
4. WebSocket infrastructure (with connectivity issues)
5. State persistence infrastructure (with bugs)
6. Error boundaries and loading states
7. Basic timer display

### Critical Issues ðŸš¨
1. **Story Management**: Add/Create story buttons are non-functional
2. **WebSocket Stability**: Connection drops frequently, offline state common
3. **State Persistence**: Corrupted state errors, session data not maintained
4. **Core Voting**: Cannot select cards or submit votes
5. **Missing Features**: Timer controls, data export, mobile optimization

## Phase 3 Priorities

### P0 - Critical Fixes (Must Have)
1. Fix story creation and management functionality
2. Stabilize WebSocket connections and real-time sync
3. Fix state persistence and session recovery
4. Implement core voting functionality (card selection, submission, reveal)
5. Complete timer implementation with host controls

### P1 - High Priority (Should Have)
6. Implement data export functionality (CSV/JSON minimum)
7. Add basic mobile responsiveness
8. Fix StoryEditor component for proper story editing
9. Add session statistics and summary
10. Implement proper error recovery flows

### P2 - Medium Priority (Nice to Have)
11. PWA implementation with offline support
12. Advanced analytics and charts
13. Push notifications
14. External tool integrations (Jira, Azure DevOps)

## Success Criteria
- All core planning poker functionality works end-to-end
- Multiple users can collaborate in real-time without issues
- Application remains stable under normal usage
- Data persists across browser refreshes
- Mobile users can participate effectively
- Clear error messages and recovery options for all failure scenarios

## Testing Requirements
- Manual testing of complete user flows
- Multi-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile device testing (iOS, Android)
- Network failure simulation testing
- Performance testing with 10+ concurrent users

## Timeline Estimate
- P0 fixes: 2-3 days
- P1 features: 3-4 days
- P2 features: 2-3 days
- Testing & polish: 2 days

Total: ~10-12 days for complete Phase 3 implementation
