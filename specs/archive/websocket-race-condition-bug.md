# WebSocket Race Condition Bug

## Problem Statement

Critical race condition prevents WebSocket connection on initial player join, requiring browser refresh to establish connection. This breaks the real-time multiplayer experience.

## Current Behavior

### Broken Flow
1. User visits session URL in new browser/incognito
2. User fills out join form and submits
3. API call creates player in database
4. WebSocket attempts to connect immediately
5. Backend WebSocket authentication fails (player not found)
6. Frontend shows "Disconnected" status permanently
7. **Browser refresh required** → WebSocket connects successfully

### Observed Logs (Second Browser)
```
[WebSocket] useEffect triggered: { sessionId: "ed7e4f0f-...", playerId: null, hasPlayerId: false }
[WebSocket] SessionId unchanged, skipping
[WebSocket] No playerId found, waiting for user to join session
App.tsx:169 Checking player ID for session: ed7e4f0f-... stored: null
persistence.ts:44 Persistence load result: null
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Database Transaction Timing
- API join call creates player in database
- Database transaction may not be immediately committed/visible
- WebSocket authentication middleware queries for player
- Player not found → Authentication fails → Connection rejected

### Secondary Issue: useEffect Dependencies
- WebSocket useEffect depends on `[sessionId, playerId]`
- Triggers when sessionId is set from URL (playerId still null)
- Triggers again when playerId is set after join
- Multiple rapid connection attempts may interfere

### Tertiary Issue: No Retry Mechanism
- Single failed authentication permanently marks connection as failed
- No automatic retry when player becomes available
- Frontend stuck in "Disconnected" state

## Technical Details

### Backend WebSocket Authentication Flow
```
1. Client connects to WebSocket with { sessionId, playerId, token }
2. Authentication middleware queries: Player.findUnique({ id: playerId })
3. If player not found → Authentication failed
4. If found → Connection accepted
```

### Frontend Connection Flow
```
1. User submits join form
2. API call: POST /api/sessions/:id/join
3. Response: { playerId: "xxx" }
4. localStorage.setItem(`player_${sessionId}`, playerId)
5. useWebSocket hook triggers (playerId dependency change)
6. WebSocket connection attempt begins
```

### Timing Gap
- Step 4 (localStorage) happens immediately after API response
- Step 6 (WebSocket connection) happens ~300ms later
- Database transaction from Step 2 may not be visible yet

## Previous Fix Attempts

### Attempt 1: Increased Delays
- JoinGame delay: 100ms → 750ms → 2000ms
- useWebSocket delay: 200ms → 1000ms
- **Result:** Still failed

### Attempt 2: Player Verification API Call
- Added API call to verify player exists before WebSocket connection
- **Result:** Still failed

### Attempt 3: useEffect Dependency Fix
- Changed from `[sessionId]` to `[sessionId, playerId]`
- **Result:** Still failed (user confirmed)

### Attempt 4: Authentication Retry Logic
- Added retry mechanism for authentication failures
- **Result:** Still failed

## Current State

### Files Modified
- `src/components/JoinGame.tsx` - Join delay logic
- `src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` - Connection timing and dependencies
- `src/services/websocket/client.ts` - Authentication retry logic
- `backend/src/websocket/connection-manager.ts` - Enhanced logging

### Logging Added
- Comprehensive WebSocket connection lifecycle logging
- Database query logging in backend
- Player verification logging
- Timing information for all connection attempts

## Potential Solutions for Tomorrow

### Option 1: Backend Database Verification
```javascript
// In WebSocket authentication middleware
const verifyPlayerExists = async (playerId, retries = 3) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
    const player = await db.player.findUnique({ where: { id: playerId } });
    if (player) return player;
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
  }
  return null;
};
```

### Option 2: Database Transaction Flushing
```javascript
// In session join API endpoint
await db.player.create({ data: playerData });
await db.$queryRaw`COMMIT`; // Force transaction commit
// Then respond to client
```

### Option 3: WebSocket Connection Queueing
```javascript
// Queue WebSocket connection until player is confirmed
const connectionQueue = new Map();
// Periodically retry queued connections
```

### Option 4: Optimistic Connection with Delayed Auth
```javascript
// Allow WebSocket connection immediately
// Defer authentication until player is confirmed to exist
// Use temporary "pending" state
```

## Success Criteria

- ✅ New browser joins session → WebSocket shows "Connected" immediately
- ✅ No browser refresh required
- ✅ Both browsers see all players in real-time
- ✅ Session configuration syncs correctly
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all browsers

## Testing Protocol

1. **Clean Test Environment**
   - Clear all localStorage
   - Use incognito/private browsing
   - Fresh Docker containers

2. **Multi-Browser Test**
   - Browser A: Create session
   - Browser B: Join via URL (should work without refresh)
   - Verify both show identical state

3. **Timing Verification**
   - Monitor backend logs for database queries
   - Check WebSocket authentication timing
   - Confirm no authentication failures

## Files to Investigate Tomorrow

### Backend
- `backend/src/middleware/websocket-auth.ts` - Authentication logic
- `backend/src/database/connection.ts` - Transaction handling
- `backend/src/services/session.service.ts` - Join endpoint implementation

### Frontend
- `src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` - Connection management
- `src/components/JoinGame.tsx` - Join flow timing
- `src/App.tsx` - Session state management

## Priority: Critical
This bug prevents core multiplayer functionality and creates poor user experience requiring manual browser refresh.
