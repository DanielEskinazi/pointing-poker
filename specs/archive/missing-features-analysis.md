# Missing Features Analysis - Planning Poker Application

## Overview

This document provides a detailed analysis of missing features in the current Planning Poker implementation, categorized by priority and impact.

## Feature Priority Matrix

| Feature | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Backend Infrastructure | Critical | High | P0 |
| Cross-Browser Sync | Critical | Medium | P0 |
| Data Persistence | Critical | Medium | P0 |
| Session Management | High | Medium | P1 |
| Player Management | High | Low | P1 |
| Voting Features | High | Medium | P1 |
| Statistics | Medium | Medium | P2 |
| UI/UX Improvements | Medium | Low | P2 |
| Integrations | Low | High | P3 |
| Enterprise Features | Low | High | P3 |

## User Stories for Missing Features

### Must Have (P0)
1. As a user, I want my session to persist so I don't lose progress on refresh
2. As a team, we want to collaborate from different browsers/devices
3. As a host, I want to control who can join my session

### Should Have (P1)
1. As a host, I want to remove disruptive players
2. As a player, I want to see voting history for the session
3. As a user, I want to abstain from voting on certain stories
4. As a team, we want to track our estimation velocity

### Nice to Have (P2-P3)
1. As a user, I want dark mode for late-night sessions
2. As a team lead, I want to integrate with our Jira board
3. As an enterprise user, I want SSO authentication
4. As a product owner, I want AI suggestions for story points

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start with Infrastructure**: Without backend, other features cannot be built
2. **Focus on Core Experience**: Perfect the basic flow before adding advanced features
3. **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Build MVP, gather feedback, prioritize accordingly
4. **Consider Buy vs Build**: Some features (auth, integrations) may be better as third-party services
5. **Plan for Scale**: Design architecture to support future features from day one

## Conclusion

The current implementation provides a solid foundation but lacks critical features for production use. The highest priority should be establishing backend infrastructure and persistence, followed by enhanced session and player management features. Advanced features like AI/ML and enterprise capabilities can be deferred until the core experience is solid and user feedback validates the need.
