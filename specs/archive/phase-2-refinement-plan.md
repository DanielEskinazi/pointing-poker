# Phase 2: Planning Poker Refinement & Completion Plan

## Executive Summary

After thorough analysis, the Planning Poker application has a solid foundation but critical features are incomplete or broken. The main issues are around the voting system, story management, authentication, and real-time synchronization. This plan addresses these gaps systematically.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Working
- **Session Creation**: Frontend can create sessions via API
- **Basic UI**: React components and state management
- **Database Schema**: Proper Prisma models for sessions, players, votes, stories
- **API Endpoints**: Backend controllers and services are well-structured
- **Docker Setup**: Development environment working

### ❌ What's Broken

#### 1. **Voting System (Critical)**
- **Issue**: Cannot submit votes - no stories exist to vote on
- **Root Cause**: No story creation flow in frontend
- **Impact**: Core functionality completely non-functional

#### 2. **Authentication (Critical)**
- **Issue**: Voting endpoints expect `req.user.playerId` but no auth middleware
- **Root Cause**: JWT middleware not implemented
- **Impact**: All protected endpoints return 401/500 errors

#### 3. **Real-time Sync (High)**
- **Issue**: WebSocket connection fails due to auth token requirements
- **Root Cause**: Frontend expects auth tokens that don't exist
- **Impact**: No real-time updates, feels like single-player app

#### 4. **Story Management (High)**
- **Issue**: No UI to create, edit, or manage stories
- **Root Cause**: Story components not implemented
- **Impact**: Cannot use the application for actual planning

#### 5. **Integration Gaps (Medium)**
- **Issue**: Frontend-backend data structure mismatches
- **Root Cause**: Types evolved separately
- **Impact**: Runtime errors and inconsistent state

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 2A: Core Voting Flow (Week 1) - HIGH PRIORITY

#### Task 2A.1: Fix Authentication System
```typescript
// Backend changes needed:
- Implement JWT middleware in auth.ts
- Create player tokens when joining sessions
- Update voting controller to use player ID from token
- Add token validation to WebSocket connection

// Frontend changes needed:
- Store JWT token when joining session
- Add token to API requests headers
- Pass token to WebSocket connection
```

**Files to modify:**
- `backend/src/middleware/auth.ts` - Implement JWT validation
- `backend/src/controllers/session.controller.ts` - Generate tokens on join
- `backend/src/routes/voting.ts` - Add auth middleware
- `src/services/api/client.ts` - Add auth headers
- `src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` - Fix token passing

**Success Criteria:**
- Players can join sessions and get auth tokens
- Voting endpoints work with proper authentication
- WebSocket connects with valid tokens

#### Task 2A.2: Story Management UI
```typescript
// Components to create:
- StoryCreator: Form to add new stories
- StoryList: Display stories in session
- StorySelector: Choose current story for voting
- StoryEditor: Edit story details

// Integration needed:

**Success Criteria:**
- Users can create stories in a session
- Current story is clearly displayed
- Stories persist in database

#### Task 2A.3: Complete Voting Flow
```typescript
// Fix voting chain:
1. User creates/selects story
2. Players vote on current story
3. Host reveals cards
4. Results show with consensus
5. Reset for next story

// Components to fix:
- Card.tsx - Connect to real vote submission
- App.tsx - Show voting status and results
- Add reveal/reset controls for host
```

**Files to modify:**

- Connect voting service events to WebSocket broadcasts
- Add proper authentication to socket connections
- Handle connection management and rooms

// Frontend WebSocket fixes:
- Fix connection with proper auth tokens
- Handle all voting-related events
- Update UI in real-time based on socket events
```

**Files to modify:**
- `backend/src/websocket/server.ts` - Implement event handlers
- `backend/src/services/voting.service.ts` - Emit events to WebSocket
- `src/services/websocket/client.ts` - Handle auth and events

### Phase 2D: Polish & Production (Week 4) - LOW PRIORITY

#### Task 2D.1: Data Export & Statistics
```typescript
// Features to add:
- Export session results to CSV/JSON

- Historical data views
- Performance metrics
```

#### Task 2D.2: Mobile Optimization
```typescript
// Improvements:
- Mobile-responsive voting cards
- Touch-friendly interactions
- PWA capabilities
- Offline support enhancement
```

## Technical Specifications

### Authentication Flow
```typescript
// 1. Player joins session
POST /api/sessions/:id/join
{ playerName, avatar, isSpectator }
→ Returns: { playerId, token, session }

// 2. Frontend stores token
localStorage.setItem('auth_token', token)

// 3. All API calls include token
Authorization: Bearer <token>

// 4. WebSocket connects with token
wsClient.connect(sessionId, playerId, token)
```

### Story Management Flow
```typescript
// 1. Host creates story
POST /api/sessions/:id/stories
{ title, description }
→ Creates story, marks as active

// 2. Players vote on current story
POST /api/sessions/:id/vote
{ value, confidence }
→ Creates/updates vote for current story

// 3. Host reveals cards
POST /api/sessions/:id/reveal
→ Shows all votes, calculates consensus

// 4. Host starts new round
POST /api/sessions/:id/reset
{ newStory: { title, description } }
→ Completes current story, creates new one
```

### WebSocket Event Flow
```typescript
// Voting events:
vote:submit → vote:submitted (broadcast)
cards:reveal → cards:revealed (broadcast)
game:reset → game:reset (broadcast)

// Player events:
session:join → player:joined (broadcast)
session:leave → player:left (broadcast)

// Story events:
story:create → story:created (broadcast)
story:update → story:updated (broadcast)
```

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk: WebSocket Complexity
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple events, add complexity gradually
- **Fallback**: Use polling for real-time updates if WebSocket fails

### Medium Risk: Authentication Implementation
- **Mitigation**: Use simple JWT approach, don't over-engineer
- **Fallback**: Implement session-based auth if JWT proves complex

### Low Risk: UI/UX Polish
- **Mitigation**: Focus on functionality first, polish later
- **Fallback**: Ship with basic UI if time runs short

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Task 2A.1** - Fix authentication as it blocks everything else
2. **Create story management UI** - Essential for any voting to work  
3. **Test end-to-end voting flow** - Ensure core functionality works
4. **Add real-time features** - Make it feel like a real multiplayer app

This plan addresses the most critical issues first and provides a clear path to a fully functional Planning Poker application.
