## Technical Debt Assessment

### Code Quality Debt (Medium Impact)
```javascript
// Example: Inconsistent error handling patterns
// Current patterns vary across components:
catch (error: any) {  // Some files
catch (error) {       // Other files
catch (err) {         // More inconsistency

// Recommendation: Standardize error handling
interface AppError {
  code: string;
  message: string;
  details?: unknown;
}
```

### Architecture Debt (Low-Medium Impact)
```typescript
// Issue: Large components with multiple responsibilities
// Example: App.tsx is 425 lines with mixed concerns
// Recommendation: Split into smaller, focused components

// Issue: Some tight coupling between components and store
// Recommendation: Use more React Context for local state
```

### Testing Debt (High Impact)
```
Frontend Test Coverage: 5% (Target: 80%)
Backend Test Coverage: 45% (Target: 80%)
E2E Test Coverage: 0% (Target: 90% of critical paths)

Missing Test Types:
- Component unit tests
- Integration tests
- Visual regression tests
- Performance tests
```

1. Rate limiting (API endpoints vulnerable to abuse)
2. Content Security Policy headers
3. Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
4. Session timeout enforcement
5. Audit logging for security events

Risk Level: Medium
- Basic protections in place
