# Feature 09: Interaction Design Enhancements

## Status: Pending
## Priority: High
## Estimated Effort: Medium

## Problem Statement

Current interaction design lacks essential feedback and guidance:

1. **Missing Selection State**: No visual indication of which voting card is currently selected
2. **Poor Hover Feedback**: Cards lack hover states to indicate interactivity  
3. **Disconnected Actions**: Voting cards feel separate from estimation workflow
4. **No Selection Confirmation**: Users uncertain if their vote was registered

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Clear visual feedback for card hover, selection, and confirmation states
- [ ] Integrated voting workflow with logical task progression  
- [ ] Immediate feedback when actions are completed
- [ ] Intuitive interaction patterns that guide users through the flow

## Technical Requirements

### Component Updates Required

1. **Card Component** (`src/components/Card.tsx`)
   - Add hover state styling
   - Implement selected state with clear visual distinction
   - Add loading/submitting state for vote confirmation
   - Improve touch target size for mobile

2. **Voting Workflow Integration**
   - Connect card selection with estimation prompt
   - Add intermediate confirmation step if needed
   - Provide immediate feedback on vote submission

3. **State Management Updates**
   - Track selected card state locally before submission
   - Handle optimistic updates for immediate feedback
   - Manage loading states during vote submission

## Design Specifications

### Card Interaction States

1. **Default State**
   - Subtle border, neutral background
   - Clear typography, adequate contrast
   - Minimum 44px touch target (mobile)

2. **Hover State**
   - Elevated shadow or border highlight
   - Slight scale transform (1.02x)
   - Color shift to indicate interactivity
   - Smooth transition (200ms ease)

3. **Selected State**  
   - Strong border color (primary brand color)
   - Background color change or pattern
   - Visual "pressed" or "active" appearance
   - Persistent until new selection or submission

4. **Disabled State**
   - Reduced opacity (60%)
   - No hover effects
   - Clear visual indication of unavailability

5. **Loading State**
   - Spinner or pulsing animation
   - Disabled interaction during submission
   - Maintains selected appearance

### Interaction Flow

1. **Card Selection**
   - Single click/tap to select
   - Clear visual feedback within 100ms
   - Optional: Haptic feedback on mobile

2. **Vote Confirmation**
   - Auto-submit on selection OR
   - Explicit "Submit Vote" button after selection
   - Loading state during submission
   - Success feedback on completion

3. **Vote Modification**
   - Allow re-selection before round completion
   - Clear indication when votes can be changed
   - Confirmation for vote changes if needed

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Card States
- [ ] Implement hover styling for voting cards
- [ ] Add selected state visual design
- [ ] Create loading state for vote submission
- [ ] Add smooth transitions between states

### Phase 2: Interaction Flow
- [ ] Integrate card selection with vote submission
- [ ] Add immediate feedback for user actions
- [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Handle error states gracefully

### Phase 3: Workflow Integration
- [ ] Connect card area with estimation prompt
- [ ] Add progress indicators for voting workflow
- [ ] Implement vote modification capabilities
- [ ] Add confirmation feedback

### Phase 4: Advanced Interactions
- [ ] Keyboard navigation for cards
- [ ] Accessibility improvements for screen readers
- [ ] Touch gestures and haptic feedback
- [ ] Responsive interaction patterns

## Interaction Patterns

### Desktop Experience
- Hover effects to indicate clickable elements
- Keyboard navigation with Tab/Enter/Arrow keys
- Visual focus indicators for accessibility
- Mouse cursor changes (pointer for interactive elements)

### Mobile Experience  
- Touch-optimized target sizes (minimum 44px)
- Haptic feedback for successful interactions
- Swipe gestures for secondary actions
- Long-press for contextual options

### Accessibility
- Screen reader announcements for state changes
- High contrast mode support
- Keyboard-only navigation capability
- Focus management for dynamic content

## Technical Implementation

### CSS/Styling
```scss
.voting-card {
  transition: all 200ms ease;
  min-height: 44px; // Mobile touch target
  
  &:hover {
    transform: scale(1.02);
    box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
  }
  
  &.selected {
    border-color: var(--primary-color);
    background-color: var(--primary-light);
  }
  
  &.loading {
    opacity: 0.7;
    cursor: wait;
  }
}
```

### State Management
```typescript
interface VotingState {
  selectedCard: string | null;
  isSubmitting: boolean;
  lastSubmittedVote: string | null;
  canModifyVote: boolean;
}
```

### Event Handling
```typescript
const handleCardSelect = (cardValue: string) => {
  setSelectedCard(cardValue);
  // Immediate visual feedback
  
  if (autoSubmit) {
    submitVote(cardValue);
  }
};
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Interaction Testing**
   - Hover state visual regression tests
   - Selection state persistence across re-renders
   - Loading state behavior during network delays

2. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Keyboard navigation flow
   - Screen reader announcements
   - Color contrast validation
   - Focus management

3. **Mobile Testing**  
   - Touch target size validation
   - Gesture recognition accuracy
   - Performance on low-end devices

## Dependencies

- Coordinates with Feature 07 (Visual Hierarchy) for layout integration
- Aligns with Feature 10 (Visual Design) for consistent styling
- Impacts mobile experience (Feature 11)

## Success Metrics

- Increased user confidence in vote submission
- Reduced accidental clicks/taps
- Improved task completion rates
- Positive usability testing feedback
- Reduced support requests about voting process

## Risks & Mitigation

1. **Risk**: Overly complex interactions may confuse users
   - **Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement, start with simple hover/selection

2. **Risk**: Performance impact from animations
   - **Mitigation**: Use CSS transforms, test on low-end devices

3. **Risk**: Accessibility regressions from visual enhancements
   - **Mitigation**: Parallel accessibility testing, screen reader validation

## Notes

Focus on fundamental interaction patterns first (hover, selection, feedback) before adding advanced features. Every interaction should provide clear, immediate feedback to build user confidence.
