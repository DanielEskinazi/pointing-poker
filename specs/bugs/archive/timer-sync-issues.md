# Timer Synchronization Issues

## Bug ID: TIMER-SYNC-001
**Date Created**: 2025-06-09  
**Date Resolved**: 2025-06-09  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: Fixed  
**Reported By**: User Testing  
**Fixed By**: Development Team

## Summary
Two critical timer synchronization issues affecting user experience and timer functionality.

## Issues

### 1. New Player Timer Sync Bug
**Problem**: When a new player joins a session, they see the default timer value (5:00) instead of the actual current timer state set by the host.

**Expected Behavior**: New players should see the same timer state as existing players when joining a session.

**Actual Behavior**: New players always see 5:00 timer display regardless of actual timer configuration or remaining time.

**Impact**: 
- Confusing user experience for new joiners
- Inconsistent game state across players
- Host timer changes not reflected for new players

### 2. Timer Reduction Buttons Rate Limited
**Problem**: Timer reduction buttons (-30s, -1m) trigger rate limiting too quickly, preventing time adjustments.

**Expected Behavior**: Users should be able to make reasonable timer adjustments without hitting rate limits.

**Actual Behavior**: Rate limiting blocks timer adjust events after ~20 clicks within 60 seconds.

**Impact**:
- Timer reduction appears broken to users
- Limits host's ability to manage timer effectively

## Reproduction Steps

### For Timer Sync Issue:
1. Host creates a session and configures timer to a custom duration (e.g., 10 minutes)
2. Host starts timer and lets it run for some time
3. New player joins the session
4. **BUG**: New player sees 5:00 instead of actual timer state

### For Rate Limiting Issue:
1. Host starts a timer
2. Click timer reduction buttons multiple times rapidly
3. **BUG**: After ~20 clicks, buttons stop working due to rate limiting

## Technical Analysis

### Root Causes

#### Timer Sync Issue
**Location**: Session join flow in WebSocket connection manager
**Suspected Issue**: Timer state not properly included in session join response or frontend not processing timer state correctly

**Relevant Files**:
- `backend/src/websocket/connection-manager.ts` - Session join handler
- `src/store.ts` - Frontend timer state management
- `src/services/websocket/client.ts` - WebSocket event handling

#### Rate Limiting Issue  
**Location**: Rate limiter configuration
**Root Cause**: `TIMER_ADJUST` event limit too restrictive (20 points/60 seconds)

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/websocket/rate-limiter.ts` - Increased limit to 100 points

## Investigation Logs

### Backend Timer Events (Sample)
```
2025-06-09 02:09:37 [debug]: WebSocket event received {"event":"timer:adjust","sessionId":"774003d1..."}
2025-06-09 02:09:37 [warn]: Rate limit exceeded for socket TrBH24sr_BPZuuYeAAAD on event timer:adjust {"current":22,"limit":20}
2025-06-09 02:09:36 [info]: Timer adjusted {"sessionId":"774003d1...","adjustmentSeconds":30,"newTimeRemaining":328.996}
```

### Frontend State Investigation Needed
- Check if `SESSION_JOINED` event includes timer state
- Verify frontend handles timer updates from WebSocket
- Ensure store properly syncs timer state on connection

## Fix Implementation

### ✅ Rate Limiting Fix (Completed)
**Change**: Increased `TIMER_ADJUST` rate limit from 20 to 100 points per 60 seconds
**File**: `backend/src/websocket/rate-limiter.ts:23`
**Status**: Deployed

### ✅ Timer Sync Fix (Completed)
**Root Cause**: Timer service was not updating session state cache when timer state changed
**Solution**: Added session state updates to timer service persistence methods

**Changes Made**:
1. **Timer Service** (`backend/src/services/timer.service.ts`):
   - Modified `persistTimerState()` to update session state cache
   - Added session state update to `loadTimerState()` method

2. **Connection Manager** (`backend/src/websocket/connection-manager.ts`):
   - Enhanced `getSessionState()` to load timer state if not cached
   - Ensures timer state is always available for new players

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// In persistTimerState():
await this.redisState.updateSessionState(sessionId, { timer: timerState });

// In getSessionState():
let timerState = cachedState?.timer;
if (!timerState) {
  timerState = await this.timerService.loadTimerState(sessionId) || undefined;
}
```

## Testing Plan

### Test Cases
1. **Multi-player Timer Sync**:
   - Host sets custom timer duration
   - Multiple players join at different times
   - Verify all players see consistent timer state

2. **Timer Adjustment Functionality**:
   - Test timer reduction buttons work consistently
   - Verify no rate limiting under normal usage
   - Test timer adjustments sync across all players

3. **Session Recovery**:
   - Test timer state persistence across reconnections
   - Verify timer continues correctly after network issues

### Success Criteria
- ✅ New players see correct timer state upon joining
- ✅ Timer reduction buttons work without rate limit issues  
- ✅ All timer changes sync in real-time across all connected players
- ✅ Timer state persists across network disconnections
