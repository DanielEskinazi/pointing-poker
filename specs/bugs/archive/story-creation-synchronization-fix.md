# Story Creation Synchronization Bug Fix

**Issue ID**: GitHub Issue #10
**Status**: Fixed
**Priority**: Critical
**Component**: WebSocket/Story Management

## Problem Description

Story creation was not syncing across sessions in real-time. When a host created a new story, it appeared immediately in the host's session but other connected sessions continued to show "No Active Story" and "No Stories Yet" until the active story changed, at which point all previously created stories would suddenly appear.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **separate StoryService instances** being created in different parts of the application:

1. **StoryController** (used by REST API endpoints) - created its own `StoryService` instance
2. **WebSocketServer** (used for real-time broadcasting) - created its own separate `StoryService` instance

Since each `StoryService` instance has its own `EventEmitter`, the events emitted by the controller's service (`story:created`, `story:updated`, etc.) never reached the WebSocket server's service event listeners.

### Code Flow Before Fix:
```
API Call → StoryController → StoryService Instance A → Emits 'story:created' on EventEmitter A
WebSocket Server → StoryService Instance B → Listens for events on EventEmitter B
Result: Events never propagate to WebSocket clients
```

## Solution Implemented

Implemented a **singleton pattern** for the `StoryService` class to ensure all components use the same instance and EventEmitter:

### Changes Made:

1. **Modified StoryService** (`backend/src/services/story.service.ts`):
   - Added static instance property
   - Modified constructor to return existing instance if one exists
   - Added `getInstance()` static method

2. **Updated StoryController** (`backend/src/controllers/story.controller.ts`):
   - Changed from `new StoryService()` to `StoryService.getInstance()`

3. **Updated WebSocketServer** (`backend/src/websocket/server.ts`):
   - Changed from `new StoryService()` to `StoryService.getInstance()`

### Code Flow After Fix:
```
API Call → StoryController → StoryService Singleton → Emits 'story:created' on EventEmitter
WebSocket Server → StoryService Singleton → Listens for events on same EventEmitter
Result: Events properly propagate to all WebSocket clients in real-time
```

## Testing

The fix ensures that:
- Story creation immediately appears on all connected sessions
- Story updates sync in real-time across all browser tabs
- Story activation changes are broadcast immediately
- Story deletion is properly synchronized

## Files Modified

- `backend/src/services/story.service.ts` - Added singleton pattern
- `backend/src/controllers/story.controller.ts` - Use singleton instance
- `backend/src/websocket/server.ts` - Use singleton instance

## Impact

- **User Experience**: Restored real-time collaborative functionality
- **Core Functionality**: Story management synchronization now works properly
- **Multi-player Sessions**: Players can see stories created by host immediately
- **Performance**: No performance impact (same instance reuse)

## Notes

- This fix maintains backward compatibility
- No API changes required
- No database schema changes required
- Pattern can be applied to other services if similar issues arise
