# Story Duplication Bug on Host Screen

**Issue**: Story Duplication on Host When Creating Stories
**Status**: Fixed
**Priority**: High
**Component**: Frontend/State Management

## Problem Description

When the host creates a new story, it appears duplicated on the host's screen but shows correctly (single instance) on other players' screens. This creates confusion for the host and makes it appear as if multiple stories were created when only one was intended.

## Visual Evidence

**Host Screen**: Shows 4 stories with duplicates of "1" and "2"
**Other Player Screen**: Shows 2 stories correctly (no duplicates)

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **double state updates** in the story creation flow:

### The Problematic Flow:
1. **Host creates story** → `addStory()` function called
2. **Optimistic Update** (Line 533): Story immediately added to local state
3. **API Call** succeeds and backend broadcasts WebSocket event
4. **WebSocket Handler** (Line 1003): Same story added again via `handleStoryCreated()`
5. **Result**: Host has duplicate story, other users only get WebSocket update (correct)

### Code Flow:
```
HOST: API Call → Optimistic Update (+1) → WebSocket Event → Handler (+1) = DUPLICATE ❌
OTHER: No API call → WebSocket Event → Handler (+1) = CORRECT ✅
```

### Problematic Code:
```typescript
// addStory() - Optimistic update
set(state => ({
  stories: [...state.stories, newStory], // First addition
  ...
}));

// handleStoryCreated() - WebSocket handler  
set(state => ({
  stories: [...state.stories, data.story], // Second addition (duplicate!)
  ...
}));
```

## Solution Implemented

Added **deduplication logic** in the WebSocket story creation handler to prevent adding stories that already exist:

### Fixed Code:
```typescript
handleStoryCreated: (data: { story: StoryInfo }) => {
  set(state => {
    // Check if story already exists (prevents duplication from optimistic updates)
    const existingStory = state.stories.find(story => story.id === data.story.id);
    if (existingStory) {
      console.log('Story already exists, skipping WebSocket duplicate:', data.story.id);
      return state; // No changes needed
    }

    return {
      stories: [...state.stories, data.story],
      currentStory: data.story.isActive ? data.story.title : state.currentStory,
      lastSync: new Date()
    };
  });
},
```

## Fix Benefits

- ✅ **Eliminates duplication**: Host sees correct story count
- ✅ **Maintains optimistic updates**: Fast UI response preserved  
- ✅ **Preserves real-time sync**: Other players still get immediate updates
- ✅ **Defensive programming**: Handles any future duplication scenarios
- ✅ **Debug logging**: Console logs when duplicates are prevented

## Testing

The fix ensures:
1. **Host creates story** → Shows once on host screen
2. **Other players** → See story appear immediately (no change in behavior)
3. **Story functionality** → All features continue to work normally
4. **No side effects** → Story updates, deletion, activation unaffected

## Files Modified

- `src/store.ts` - Added deduplication logic in `handleStoryCreated()` handler

## Impact

- **User Experience**: Host no longer sees confusing duplicate stories
- **Data Integrity**: Story count remains accurate across all sessions
- **Collaboration**: Improved clarity for planning poker sessions
