# Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Implementation

## Overview
Phase 1 focuses on establishing the fundamental backend infrastructure and integrating it with the existing frontend. This phase transforms the client-only Planning Poker application into a full-stack application with real-time synchronization across browsers.

## Timeline
**Duration**: 2 weeks (80-100 hours)

## Stories

### Backend Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. **[Backend API Setup](01-backend-api-setup.md)** (5 points)
   - Node.js/Express server setup
   - TypeScript configuration
   - Basic middleware and routing

2. **[Database Setup](02-database-setup.md)** (8 points)
   - PostgreSQL and Redis configuration
   - Schema creation and migrations
   - Connection management

3. **[WebSocket Server Setup](03-websocket-setup.md)** (8 points)
   - Socket.io integration
   - Real-time event handling
   - Connection state management

4. **[Session Management API](04-session-api.md)** (8 points)
   - CRUD operations for sessions
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Session persistence

5. **[Player and Voting API](05-player-voting-api.md)** (13 points)
   - Player management endpoints
   - Voting submission and retrieval
   - Game flow control

### Frontend Integration (Week 2)
6. **[WebSocket Client Integration](06-websocket-client-integration.md)** (8 points)
   - Replace BroadcastChannel with Socket.io
   - Connection status management
   - Real-time state synchronization

7. **[API Client Integration](07-api-client-integration.md)** (8 points)
   - Axios setup with interceptors
   - React Query integration
   - Error handling

8. **[State Persistence](08-state-persistence.md)** (8 points)
   - Session recovery after refresh
   - Offline queue management
   - State synchronization

### Infrastructure & Deployment
9. **[Docker Development Environment](09-docker-setup.md)** (5 points)
   - Docker Compose configuration
   - Development environment setup
   - Production builds

10. **[CI/CD Pipeline](10-deployment-pipeline.md)** (8 points)
    - GitHub Actions setup
    - Automated testing and deployment
    - Environment management

## Total Story Points: 79

## Dependencies
- Stories 1-5 can be worked on in parallel by backend developers
- Stories 6-8 depend on backend APIs being available
- Story 9 can be started immediately
- Story 10 depends on having deployable applications

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Backend API server running with PostgreSQL and Redis
- [ ] WebSocket real-time synchronization working across browsers
- [ ] Frontend successfully integrated with backend APIs
- [ ] Session persistence across page refreshes
- [ ] Docker development environment functional
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline deploying to staging environment

## Key Deliverables
1. Fully functional backend API with documentation
2. Database schema with migration system
3. WebSocket server handling real-time events
4. Updated frontend using backend services
5. Docker-based development environment
6. Automated deployment pipeline

## Technical Decisions
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express/Fastify and TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistence, Redis for caching/pub-sub
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for WebSocket communication
- **Frontend**: Existing React app with API integration
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Fly.io (backend)

## Risks and Mitigations
1. **Risk**: WebSocket scaling issues
   - **Mitigation**: Redis adapter for Socket.io from the start

2. **Risk**: State synchronization conflicts
   - **Mitigation**: Implement conflict resolution in Story 8

3. **Risk**: Database performance
   - **Mitigation**: Proper indexing and connection pooling

4. **Risk**: Complex local development setup
   - **Mitigation**: Docker Compose for one-command startup

## Next Phase Preview
Phase 2 will focus on enhanced session management features:
- Session passwords and access control
- Host/admin controls
- Player management (kick, spectator mode)
- Session persistence and recovery
- Advanced voting features
